Write a program that finds the three most frequently occurring integers in positions a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1] of an array.  
You can assume that the array contains at least three distinct values, and there are no ties in terms of frequency among the three most frequently occurring elements.s
Sample Case : 
Input : 11 
1 2 3 1 2 3 3 3 2 3 4
Output : 3 2 1
